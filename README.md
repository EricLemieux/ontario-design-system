# Ontario Design System

Npm package to wrap the official download for the Ontario Design System.

Because of the way that the Ontario Design System is published, zip archive versus npm package, it adds friction before
you can integrate it into your project. The intention with this repository is to make it easier to download and connect
the design system to a project.

In this current stage this is just a proof of concept, for real world usage the following is a non-exhaustive list of
tasks that would need to be completed.

* Publish on npm
* Checksum to ensure that downloaded archive is what is expected
* Error handling
* Validation and testing on more operating systems
